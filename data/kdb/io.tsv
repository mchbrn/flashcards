Question	Answer
How is I/O realised?	Via handles.
What are handles?	Symbolic names of resources e.g. files or machines on a network.
What is a one-and-done operation?	One that can be carried out directly on the symbolic handle e.g. you can read a file into memory in one operation.
What is a continuing operation?	One in which the symbolic handle must first be opened to obtain an open handle to operate on.
What flavors do files come in?	Text and binary.
What character do text processing routines have in their name?	0
What character do binary processing routines have in their name?	1
How are text files considered in q?	As a list of strings, a list of char lists
How are binary files considered in q?	As a list of byte lists
What is a file handle?	A symbol that represents the name of a directory or file in persistent storage.
What form do symbolic file handles take?	`:[path]name
How do you get the size of a file in bytes?	hcount `:/path/to/file
How do you delete a file?	hdel `:/path/to/file
How do you write binary data to a file?	`:/path/to/file set 42
What is returned following a set operation?	The symbolic handle of the written file, which is automatically closed after the write is complete.
How do you read serialised q data from a file?	get `:/path/to/file or value `:/path/to/file or \l /path/to/file
What does opening a symbolic handle return?	A function called an open handle that is used to perform operations.
How do you open a data file handle and what is its resulting function called?	hopen returns the open handle.
How do you append to a file containing serialised q data?	h:hopen `:/path/to/file \n h[42] \n h 100 200 \n hclose h
How do you close the open handle?	hclose h
Does hopen create a new file if none exists?	Yes
How do you read a binary file in as a list of bytes?	read1 `:/path/to/file
How do you write raw binary data to a file?	`:/path/to/file 1: 0x06072a`
How do you use dot amend to write/overwrite a file?	.[`:/path/to/file; (); :; 1001 1002 1003]
How do you use dot amend to append a file?	.[`:/path/to/file; (); ,; 42]
What does save write tables to a file?	save serialises a table in a global variable to a binary file of the same name.
How do you use save to write a table to a file.	t:([] c1:`a`b`c; c2:1 2 3) \n save `:/path/to/t
How do you use load to read a serialised table from a file into a variable of the same name?	load `:/path/to/t
How do you save a tab delimited table called t to a .txt file?	save `:/path/to/t.txt
Is there a corresponding load for reading a table from a .txt file?	No
What determines if data will be saved as binary or text data using save?	The file extension
What is a splayed table?	A table whose columns are serialised to their own file.
What are the advantages of splayed tables?	Some tables are too large ot fit into memory on all machines so serialising columns individually requires a fraction of the memory and when querying a splayed table, only the columns referred to in the query will be loaded into memory.
How do you splay a table?	Use set and specify a directory as the target location.
How do you get the column order of a splayed table?	get hsym `$"/path/to/.d"
What restrictions are there on splayed tables?	All columns must be simple or compound lists and symbol columns must be enumerated.
How do you read the file /path/to/file.txt?	read0 `:/path/to/file.txt
How can you see the underlying binary values of /path/to/file.txt?	read1 `:/path/to/file.txt
How do you read /path/to/file.txt as binary values and convert back to text?	"c"$read1 `:/path/to/file.txt
How do you write a list of strings to /path/to/file.txt?	`:/path/to/file.txt 0: ("Life", "The Universe, "And Everything")
Do 0: and 1: overwrite or append?	Overwrite
How do you write text data to /path/to/file.txt with an open handle?	h:hopen `:/file/to/path.txt \n neg[h] enlist "This" \n neg[h] ("and"; "that) \n hclose h
Does writing to an open handle overwrite or append to an existing file?	Append
